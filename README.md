<h2 align="center"> Lyra </h2>
<p> A headless lightweight CMS targeted towards frontend devs </p>

Lyra is still in heavy development. This is only an alpha version.

# Installation
There is an api server and a client dashhboard to interact with the API server built with React. You must start both
projects manually by running *node server.js* in the root folder and navigating into the dashboard folder and running
*yarn start*.. Yes we understand this is less than elegant, but there is a lot of work we havent done yet, so we are
doing it this way for now.
